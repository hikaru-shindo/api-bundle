This is a simple symfony bundle for creating simple APIs 
with validation of incoming resources and automatic 
serialization of outgoing resources.

## Getting started

TBD

## Special Thanks

This bundle is based on an idea by Celestino Diaz ([@celestino](https://www.github.com/celestino)).  
I want to take the opportunity to thank him here for his idea and great inputs.
